 *@brief Functions and makros related to interpreting and executing command received over Bluetooth<br>
 *
 *Command should follow specific format, explained below:<br>
 *In general command starts with capital letter indicating specific action followed, every meaningful information should be separated by '/'.<br>
 *Command list:<br>
 *Setting RTC time - "T/HOURS/MINUTES/WEEKDAY/" For instance "T/9/59/3/" sets current time to 9:59 Wednesday.<br>
 *Setting days between measurements - "F/HOUR_OF_MEASUREMENT/DAYS_BETWEEN_MEASUREMENTS/". Only 1-7 day periods are allowed. For instance "F/12/2/" will perform automatic measurements every other day at 12 AM.<br>
 *Setting amount of time that pump should water the plant - "A/AMOUNT/".For instance "A/20/59/3/" will make pump turn on for 20s.<br>
 *Requesting data from sensors - "D/" performs asynchronic measuremnet.For instance "D/" will start asynchronic measurement.<br>
 *Sending data - Sending data form uc to Bluetooth device - "S/SOIL_MOISTURE/TEMPERTURE/AIR_MOISTURE/" For instance "S/70/29/30/" means 70% soil moisture, 29 Celcius degrees and 30% air humidity.<br>
